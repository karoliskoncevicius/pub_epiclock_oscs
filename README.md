# Epigenetic age oscillates during the day

Supplementary data and R scripts for reproducing results of [Epigenetic age oscillates during the day](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.14170) publication.

Data tables, such as epigenetic age predictions and cellcount estimates for samples used in the data analysis, are located within the `input/` directory.

R scripts use the data from `input/` in order to reproduce the plots found in the paper.
The name of each script specifies the figure names that will be reproduced after executing the script.
For example the script named `fig_1_efg.r` produces a file `fig_1_efg.pdf` that contains Figures: 1e, 1f, and 1g.
